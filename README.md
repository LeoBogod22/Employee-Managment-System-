     As we also know what Library Management System does, it is a simple GUI software/program to manage the books/articles and whatever that is present in the library and sure if that is issue-able(you can issue a sofa/couch/tables/chairs even though those are present in the library) it will help librarian as well the registered users to manage and view the library with the book/article book-shelf position.
